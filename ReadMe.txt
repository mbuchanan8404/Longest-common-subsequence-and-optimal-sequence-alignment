This project is a Visual Studios 2017 project.
Upon running, the following will occur:
   1: The user will be prompted to select between LCS and OSA.
   2: The user will be prompted for two strings of english letters.
   3: If LCS was selected, the LCS for the two input strings is displayed
   along with the length of the LCS.
   4: If OSA was selected, the user will be prompted for the scoring parameters.
   The user will then be presented with one possible OSA of the two strings, and a score;
   5: The program will pause, then terminate.
